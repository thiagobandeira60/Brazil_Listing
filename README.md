The goal for this project is to do pre-processing only, to have the file ready for processing later.
Some of the issues that will be addressed in this project are:

- Dropping unnecessary columns
- Changing columns data types
- Feature engineering, creating new columns
- Standardization
- Dealing with Outliers
- Dealing with missing data
- imputation techniques
